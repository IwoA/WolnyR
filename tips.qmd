## 1. Use RStudio

## 2. Be careful of syntax

-   R is case sensitive (Python as well)

. . . 

`print()` function is a build-in in R contrary to `Print()` which doesn't exist.

The same applies to variables' names.

-   Remember about commas, parentheses, etc.

-   Different types of parentheses mean different things.

## 3. Comment your code

It's good for you, for other readers and for future-self.

You will be surprised how fast you forget what you have written.

## 4. Curate a set of helpful R resources & people

-   Github
-   Youtube
-   Blogs
-   Websites
-   [**stackoverflow**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)
-   [**Big Book of R**](https://www.bigbookofr.com/)

## 5. Check the date on resources & advice pages

-   Some functions are superseded by something better.
-   Some packages are no longer maintained
-   New, better packages replace old ones

## 6. Form a community of practice

Especially useful for learning and doing research

## 7. Don't just follow the recipe

Don't blindly copy old/similar code updating only some values.

## 8. Get feedback on your work

## 9. Don't be overhelmed
